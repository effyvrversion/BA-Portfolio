# Data Analysis Portfolio
## Project1 Video Game Analysis
Analyse the dataset of video games from 1980 to 2023 for finding out the changing patterns of game industry and correlation between different parameters. 
## Project2 Artwork Analysis
The project aims to find connection between digital artwork metadata and color patterns that may shed light on broader artistic style. The extraction of source data combines web scraping and API access. Here I made an overview of Rijksmuseum metadata and detailed analysis of two representative artists-Vincent van Gogh and Rembrandt van Rijn.
## Project3 SQL:Mondial Data
Mondial is a set of tables that cover information of country, border, economy, population and nature resourcess. I select this database to explore the state of nature resource sustainability and its relation with economy.
